# MyMovies
> IOS application


MyMovies is an application where you can look up all movies and series. You can request a detailed list to provide more information about a particular film or series.  There is also a possibility to add them to your watchlist or favorites. 

Furthermore, this app also offers the possibility to consult the latest releases of Netflix, so you can already look forward to a brand new season of your favorite series.

If you like to let your friends know about a movie or series that you liked very much, you can share it through different platforms (mail, messages, messenger,...).
